Here are the essential commands:\\n\\n- **Container**: `.container` - Creates a responsive container with a fixed width.\\n- **Fluid Container**: `.container-fluid` - Creates a full-width container that spans the entire viewport.\\n- **Row**: `.row` - Defines a row to contain columns.\\n- **Columns**: `.col-{breakpoint}-{number}` - Defines the column width within a row. `{breakpoint}` can be `xs` (extra small), `sm` (small), `md` (medium), `lg` (large), or `xl` (extra large).\\n\\n### Typography\\n\\nBootstrap provides styles for enhancing typography. Here are some key points:\\n\\n- **Headings**: `<h1>` to `<h6>` - Bootstrap provides styles for headings.\\n- **Paragraph**: `.lead` - Increases the font size for a paragraph to make it stand out.\\n- **Text Alignment**: `.text-{left|center|right|justify}` - Aligns text within its container.\\n\\nThese elements form the backbone of Bootstrap\'s layout and typography, allowing developers to create responsive and visually appealing web designs efficiently."},{"id":"Tables Layout","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Tables Layout","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-26-tables-layout.md","title":"Tables Layout","description":"Historically, table-based layouts were a common approach for structuring webpages in HTML.

This technical note aims to explore the deprecated table-based layout in HTML, its drawbacks, and modern alternatives.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Table-based Layout in HTML:\\nIn the early days of web development, tables were primarily used for tabular data presentation. However, developers started utilizing HTML tables to create entire page layouts by nesting tables within tables. This approach involved defining rows and columns to position content elements, such as text, images, and navigation menus, within the table structure.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Drawbacks of Table-based Layouts:\\nWhile table-based layouts were once popular, they have several significant drawbacks:\\n\\n1. ***Semantic Implications***: Tables were originally intended for tabular data, not layout purposes. Misusing tables for layout can result in poor semantic structure, making it harder for search engines to interpret the content correctly.\\n\\n2. ***Accessibility Issues***: Screen readers and other assistive technologies may struggle to navigate and interpret table-based layouts effectively, leading to accessibility barriers for users with disabilities.\\n\\n3. ***Maintenance Challenges***: Table-based layouts often result in convoluted and inflexible code, making it challenging to maintain and update the webpage design.\\n\\n4. ***Poor Responsiveness***: Table-based layouts lack responsiveness, making it difficult to adapt the layout to different screen sizes and devices, leading to a poor user experience on mobile devices."},{"id":"Flex Layout","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Flex Layout","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-25-flex-layout.md","title":"Flex Layout","description":"Flexbox is a powerful layout model in CSS that allows you to create flexible and efficient layouts.

It\'s particularly handy for creating responsive designs and aligning items within a container.\\n\\n## Basics of Flexbox\\n\\nFlexbox operates on two main axes: the main axis and the cross axis. You can control the layout of items along these axes using various properties.\\n\\n### Setting up a Flex Container\\n\\nTo create a flex container, you first need to set the `display` property of the container to `flex`. This tells the browser to use flex layout for the container\'s children.\\n\\n```css\\n.container {\\n  display: flex;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Flex Direction\\n\\nThe `flex-direction` property determines the main axis along which flex items are laid out. The default value is `row`, which lays out items horizontally.\\n\\n```css\\n.container {\\n  flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Justify Content\\n\\nThe `justify-content` property aligns items along the main axis of the flex container. It\'s useful for distributing extra space when the items don\'t fill the container.\\n\\n```css\\n.container {\\n  justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Align Items\\n\\nThe `align-items` property aligns items along the cross axis of the flex container. It\'s handy for controlling vertical alignment of items within a container.\\n\\n```css\\n.container {\\n  align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nFlexbox provides a flexible and efficient way to create layouts in CSS. By understanding and leveraging its properties, you can easily create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices."},{"id":"Grid Layout","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Grid Layout","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-25-grid-layout.md","title":"Grid Layout","description":"Grid layout on a website refers to the arrangement of content elements using a grid system, where the webpage is divided into columns and rows to create a structured layout.

This approach offers designers precise control over the placement and alignment of various elements such as text, images, navigation menus, and other components.\\n\\n1. **Structuring the Grid**: The webpage is conceptualized as a grid, with horizontal rows and vertical columns forming a framework. Designers determine the number of columns, their widths, and the spacing between them to establish the grid\'s structure. \\n\\n2. **Placing Content Elements**: Each content element is positioned within the grid by specifying its placement in terms of grid columns and rows. Designers can allocate specific grid areas for different sections of the webpage, such as headers, sidebars, main content, and footers. This allows for a logical organization of content and facilitates navigation.\\n\\n3. **Creating Responsive Layouts**: With the advent of mobile devices and varying screen sizes, responsive design has become essential. Grid layout enables designers to create responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly to different viewport sizes. Media queries and grid layout techniques are used to adjust column widths, rearrange content, and optimize the layout for optimal viewing on devices of all sizes.\\n\\n4. **Maintaining Accessibility**: Accessibility considerations are crucial in web design. Designers ensure that grid layouts maintain readability, logical tab order, and sufficient contrast between elements to accommodate users with diverse needs and disabilities.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# CSS Styling with Grid\\n\\nCSS Grid Layout is a powerful two-dimensional layout system that allows you to design complex web layouts with ease.

They offer stronger security compared to password-based authentication, as the private key is never transmitted over the network, reducing the risk of interception or brute-force attacks.\\n\\n1.\\t**Public Key**: The public key is placed on the SSH server that you want to access securely. It is freely distributable and can be shared with anyone. The server uses the public key to encrypt data that can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key.\\n\\n2.\\t**Private Key**: The private key is kept securely on the client side, typically in a file or stored in an SSH agent. It should never be shared with anyone else. When the client attempts to connect to the SSH server, it presents the private key for authentication. The server then checks this private key against the corresponding public key stored on the server.

It enables users to securely log in to remote systems or servers from anywhere with network connectivity. \\n\\n3.\\t**Remote Command Execution**: SSH allows users to execute commands on remote systems as if they were physically present at the console. This capability is particularly useful for system administration, troubleshooting, and automation tasks.\\n\\n4.\\t**Secure File Transfer**: SSH supports secure file transfer protocols, such as Secure Copy (SCP) and Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), allowing users to securely transfer files between local and remote systems or between different remote systems.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How to get your SSH key for your Git repository?
