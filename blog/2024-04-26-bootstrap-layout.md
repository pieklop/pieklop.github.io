# Bootstrap

Here are some examples of uses of bootstrap in code

### Grid System

Bootstrap offers a flexible grid system for creating responsive layouts. Here are the essential commands:

- **Container**: `.container` - Creates a responsive container with a fixed width.
- **Fluid Container**: `.container-fluid` - Creates a full-width container that spans the entire viewport.
- **Row**: `.row` - Defines a row to contain columns.
- **Columns**: `.col-{breakpoint}-{number}` - Defines the column width within a row. `{breakpoint}` can be `xs` (extra small), `sm` (small), `md` (medium), `lg` (large), or `xl` (extra large).

### Typography

Bootstrap provides styles for enhancing typography. Here are some key points:

- **Headings**: `<h1>` to `<h6>` - Bootstrap provides styles for headings.
- **Paragraph**: `.lead` - Increases the font size for a paragraph to make it stand out.
- **Text Alignment**: `.text-{left|center|right|justify}` - Aligns text within its container.

These elements form the backbone of Bootstrap's layout and typography, allowing developers to create responsive and visually appealing web designs efficiently.
